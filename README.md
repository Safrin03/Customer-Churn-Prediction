# "Predictive Analytics for Customer Churn: A Machine Learning Approach"

## Summary 
In this project, I utilized logistic regression for churn prediction. I performed Pre-processing , Validation, feature engineering, categorical encoding, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation. This project aims to enhance customer retention strategies for a subscription-based service.

## Approach
Explored the data by examining its structure and contents. Pre-processed the data by converting categorical variables & encoding them using one-hot encoding and label encoding. Split the training data into training and validation sets for model evaluation. Trained a logistic regression model on the training data and evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. Fine-tuned the model using grid search with cross-validation. Made predictions on the test data using the best model and created a prediction.

## Solution
My solution achieved the project objectives by effectively predicting whether subscriptions in the test dataset would be continued for another month. To accomplish this, I employed logistic regression as the predictive model. During the evaluation stage, I utilized various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC to assess the model's effectiveness. My solution achieved an ROC AUC of 0.7455, accuracy of 82.46%, and provided valuable insights for targeted interventions, ensuring a proactive approach to customer retention.
